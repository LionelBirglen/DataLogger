**Open source data logger for voltage and current using Teensy 3.5 microcontroller**<br>
Reads current and/or voltage and records data on SD card<br>
Based on DFRobot INA219-based board<br>
Supports voltage from 0 to 26 V and current for -8 to +8 A (bidirectionnal)<br>
Sampling frequency of the recordings adjustable from 5 to 1000 Hz<br>
Sampling buffer size of either 2,000 or 20,000 measurements<br>
Optional zero-phase filtering of the data<br>
