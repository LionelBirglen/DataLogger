Open source data logger for voltage and current using Teensy 3.5 microcontroller
Reads current and/or voltage and records data on SD card
Based on DFRobot INA219-based board
Supports voltage from 0 to 26 V and current for -8 to +8 A (bidirectionnal)
Sampling frequency of the recordings adjustable from 5 to 1000 Hz
Sampling buffer size of either 2,000 or 20,000 measurements
Optional zero-phase filtering of the data
